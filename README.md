### âœ… Final Tips

- Rename your repository: `football-game-pygame`
- Place this file as `README.md` at the **root of your GitHub project**
- Add gameplay screenshots if you can â€” it attracts attention!

Let me know if you want:
- A `LICENSE` file
- GitHub repo structure setup (`.gitignore`, folders, etc.)
- Instructions for bundling into `.exe`

Happy coding and welcome to game development! ðŸŽ®âš½
